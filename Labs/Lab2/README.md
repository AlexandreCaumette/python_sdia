# Lab2 

## Objectives 

Acquire practice with libraries commonly used in data science (`numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `hdf5`, `matplotlib`).

## Assessment 

This lab session will be evaluated, based on your answer to the exercises reported in the Jupyter notebook.\
Any code produced should be commented whenever appropriate, custom functions and objects documented and unit-tested (see Lab1).\
Figures produced should be clearly annotated (axis, title, legend whenever appropriate).

Your aswers will be evaluated depending on:
1. Numerical correctness
2. Implementation clarity (documentation, relevance of the comments)
3. Unit-tests developed whenever appropriate (correctness, relevance)
4. Answers to the questions and overall presentation of the Jupyter notebook.

## Submission Guidelines

The dropbox file request, the exact format and the deadline will be announced in the next session (session 3)
